# routerApp
- This is a simple and powerful Router App like frameworks
- first build your page as you want and need inside components directory .. like home.php or login.php or any you want
- I just biuld home.php, about.php and contact.php for example
- then make a new instance for Router Class
- then use get($route, $pathToFile); for get method
- or use post($route, $pathToFile); for post method
- then run();
- as like in index.php

- note: any route doesn't installed as like in index.php .. it will response and render a 404 not found page
